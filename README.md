# Raspberry-Pi-Security-Camera
I have created a repo that you can use to setup a raspberry pi security system.



Change the info in mail.py to your info

Change the cv2.imwrite() functions in motion_detection.py to the path of your folder

to test make sure your camera is in a place where the is no constant movement like a room. 
in the terminal type: python motion_detection.py
now your good to test
go into the room and walk around. Look for an email in your inbox
